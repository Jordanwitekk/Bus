# Bus
Project title : Real-Time-Bus-Tracker 





Desprection:

This is an exercise developed during MIT xPro Full Stack Bootcamp.The objective is to create a real-time bus tracker application by fetching live bus data from the MBTA API and animating the map to show the locations of buses in the selected area. The exercise is about creating a custom map using mapbox( open-source platform to create and display maps on a web page) for all bus stops between MIT & Harvard. A marker was added to a specific location. A move() function was written that is called when the button "Show stops between MIT and Harvard" is selected.

 How to run:
